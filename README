Description:

	Artificial Intelligence: CS 4300
	Project #1: Missionaries and Cannibals

	Three missionaries and three cannibals are on one side of a river, along with a boat that can
	hold one or two people. Find a way to get everyone to the other side without ever leaving a
	group of missionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that place.
	
Solution Method:

	The program implements and iterative deepening depth first search algorithm to generate a goal path.
	A state is represented with a three-element integer array.
	The path from goal state to start state is stored in a stack of integer pointers.
	
Environment:

	Developed using Eclipse IDE.
	See Makefile for compilation details.

Files:

	miss_cann.cpp:		Main driver file.
	
	tree.h: 			Declares structure for the Tree class.
	
	tree.cpp: 			Defines methods for the Tree class.
